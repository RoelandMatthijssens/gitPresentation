\begin{frame}
	\begin{block}{Local repository}
		Entire history is stored locally. So no network latency
		\begin{itemize}
			\item no need to request old revision
			\item fast diffs
			\item fast commits
			\item fast revert
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{clone and pull?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Total repo size is small
			\item so clone is fast
			\item pull only retrieves deltas which are small
		\end{itemize}
